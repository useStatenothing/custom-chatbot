An embedded system is a combination of computer hardware and software designed for a specific function. Embedded systems may also function within a larger system. The systems can be programmable or have a fixed functionality. Industrial machines, consumer electronics, agricultural and processing industry devices, automobiles, medical equipment, cameras, digital watches, household appliances, airplanes, vending machines and toys, as well as mobile devices, are possible locations for an embedded system.

An embedded system is a microprocessor- or microcontroller-based system of hardware and software designed to perform dedicated functions within a larger mechanical or electrical system.

A system on a chip or system-on-chip   is an integrated circuit that integrates most or all components of a computer or other electronic system. These components almost always include on-chip central processing unit (CPU), memory interfaces, input/output devices and interfaces, and secondary storage interfaces, often alongside other components such as radio modems and a graphics processing unit (GPU) â€“ all on a single substrate or microchip

SoCs are in contrast to the common traditional PC architecture, which separates hardware components based on function and connects them through a central interfacing circuit board called the motherboard.[nb 1] Whereas a motherboard houses and connects detachable or replaceable components, SoCs integrate all of these components into a single integral circuit. An SoC will typically integrate a CPU, graphics and memory interfaces,

Driven by technology disruptions and a raging pandemic, global majors in the hi-tech industry are looking to scale and outcompete rivals by outsourcing critical pieces of development work to innovative design services partners. Large design services companies are unable to build a high-quality pool of resources with specialized skills due to their large overheads and previous generation financial models.

As a result, they can only subcontract and act as a distribution channel for niche, specialized smaller firms such as P2F that have built enduring supply chains at the right cost. Since its inception, P2F's expert teams have successfully taped out tens of complex SoCs in various domains and industry segments for major semiconductor and technology businesses worldwide. Our engineers are extremely comfortable working across a variety of technology nodes, tools and flows, design tools and techniques, and are skilled at handing off designs without surprises.
